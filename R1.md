## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

My focus for this round of 100 days of code challenge is to reacquaint myself about web development again and will follow freeCodeCamp.org Responsive Web Design Certification.

### Day 1: December 9. 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started reviewing HTML5 tags

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at learning again.

### Day 2: December 10. 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic HTML and HTML5 chapter.

**Thoughts:** Its a very quick review, like mostly working through exercises and recalling syntax. (Just like riding a bike!)
