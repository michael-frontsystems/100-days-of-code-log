## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

My focus for this round of 100 days of code challenge is to reacquaint myself about web development again and will follow freeCodeCamp.org Responsive Web Design Certification.

### Day 1: December 9. 2019 Monday

**Today's Progress**: Started reviewing HTML5 tags

**Thoughts:** Feels good to be back at learning again.

### Day 2: December 10. 2019 Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished basic HTML and HTML5 chapter.

**Thoughts:** Its a very quick review, like mostly working through exercises and recalling syntax. (Just like riding a bike!)

### Day 3: December 12. 2019 Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started with Basic CSS.

**Thoughts:** Started with reviewing CSS now and I reached lesson 16/44 on this session

### Cancelled: December 23. 2019 Monday

**Thoughts:** This round of 100 days of code will be cancelled because of a change in focus/priorities. I think I need to focus more on Xamarin, C# and Prism since it is the language I use @ work and I need to dig deeper on this and learn more about my current project's architecture. I know I can resume this course anytime when I feel more confident and capable on this new focus.
